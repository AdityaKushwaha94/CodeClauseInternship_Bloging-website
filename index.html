                    <h2>Nerd Wallet</h2>
                    <p>Health and fitness advice for nerds and ordinary, everyday people.

                        Steve Kamb started Nerd Fitness nearly 10 years ago when he noticed that there were a ton of health and fitness blogs, but nothing catering specifically to him. So he decided to build it himself.
                        
                        Instead of targeting anyone and everyone, his blog was directly for… nerds! The interesting part is that the definition of the term “nerd” evolved as the site grew. At first, his audience consisted of people like him – nerds who played computer games and just wanted to get fit.
                        
                        Today, his brand has grown into a massive community of regular people who just want to learn how to get fit and have fun doing it.
                        
                        What they do well: Differentiating themselves from all the other health blogs by going extremely specific in their audience targeting.</p>

                    <h2>Css Tricks</h2>
                    <p>A giant design and development resource centered around one big influencer.

                        Chris Coyier is one of the most well-known designers on the internet. And it’s all thanks to his wildly popular design blog, CSS Tricks. Like Nomadic Matt, a large percentage of the articles are written by Chris.
                        
                        He started the website in 2007. At the time, it was purely about CSS – hence the name. Today, it’s grown into a huge resource for all things web design and development. I visit this site several times a month myself, mainly to copy and paste in CSS lines that he shares in his blog posts.
                        
                        What they do well: Using his existing audience to launch new products/companies. For example, his website CodePen now has 1M users and traffic is double that of CSS-Tricks.</p>

                    <h2>cryptocurrency</h2>
                    <p>The leading cryptocurrency blog.

                        CoinDesk is a website I visit at least 3 times a week. It’s the most successful cryptocurrency blog in the world, getting over 10 million visitors per month. It was started in 2013 by Shakil Kha, and then acquired by Digital Currency Group in 2016 for an amount rumored to be around $500,000.
                        
                        Today, they’re the go-to source for all news and updates in the blockchain world. They make money through advertising, publishing paid reports, and selling tickets to their conferences.</p>

                    <h2>Thought thinker</h2>
                    <p>A deeper, emotional blog written by college students.

                        I don’t know if Chris Lavergne, founder of Thought Catalog, will appreciate the description above but it’s what I personally think of this blog. Thought Catalog is like BuzzFeed for hipster college students.
                        
                        You’ll mainly see articles about heart break, relationships, and being a stronger person. The coolest thing about Thought Catalog is how they developed their content. As anyone who blogs will know, it’s difficult to source good content.
                        
                        Thought Catalog attracts college students, mostly writing majors, to write on their site for free as a way to build their portfolio. It’s “cool” to be published on Thought Catalog.
                        
                        And as a result, they have hundreds of submissions every single day from some of the deepest, brightest minds all over the world. That’s amazing.</p>
